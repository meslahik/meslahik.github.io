== Tehran Game Expo & Festival 2012
There was a 4 days game development event during the expo which was held by Iranian Game Development Institute. All games were created in 4 days.\n
Our team was included by two techinical, two desginer and two art persons. The game was named "CS Boys Game".\n
Lots of our ideas couldn't be implemented.\n
It was one the most interesting events I've ever experienced.\n\n

== Graphic Course Project
This was a project we presented for Graphic course. OpenGL and DevIL Libraries are used in this project.\n
Suggestion: If you don't know why Raph Koster wrote the book "A Theory of fun in game design" you can play this game. :)\n
Actually that's because of shortage of time we had for the project.\n\n
