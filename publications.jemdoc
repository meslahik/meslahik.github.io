#The Application of Game Theory in Smart Grids in the Presence of Energy Storage Devices
#- Authors: *Mojtaba Eslahi-Kelorazi*, Fereshteh-Azadi Parand
#- Presented in /2nd National Conference on Computer Engineering and IT Management/, Tehran, Iran, June 2015.
#- Abstract: Game theory is the study of conflicts and cooperations between independent, rational agents. We used it to model cutomers' energy usage and #company-customer interactions for the future smart grids.
